Option 2: Virtual Environments (Linux or Mac OS X)
==================================================

For this make sure that you have virtualenv installed.
This also assumes that Python is installed on the system.

Go to https://github.com/uit-no/python-course
and download the repository as zip file (click
on "Download ZIP" on the right).

Then extract the zip file and inside python-course-master
you can install all requirements using::

  $ python3 -m venv venv
  $ source venv/bin/activate
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt
