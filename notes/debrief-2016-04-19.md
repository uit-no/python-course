# General

- For upcoming courses we need support from the management
- Switch from 1x3 to 2x2 days, 2 days beginners, 2 days advanced
- Possibly afternoon before beginners course schedule install party
- Keep anaconda, that worked
- We need to do a better job to make things findable on the website
- Longer and slower intro
- Redistribute testing and profiling from day 1
- When people sign up ask them for their top 3 topics they are most interested in
- Start with easy exercises, add some super easy exercises
- Provide solutions
- Perhaps add exercises in template form (advanced users could take solutions from basic exercises for advanced solutions)
