Exercises day 1
===============

We will work on these exercises during
the course. Do not worry about them before
the course.

Below you find the source code for the exercises.
Copy and paste them into a file called e.g. ``basics.py``.
It is OK to copy all or just one or two exercises
to start with. We give you the tests and you need
to code the functions to make the tests pass.
It is OK to work in pairs and it is OK to use
Google and Stack Overflow.

You can run the tests like this::

  $ py.test -vv basics.py

You can also run a single test, e.g.::

  $ py.test -vv -k test_reverse_list basics.py
